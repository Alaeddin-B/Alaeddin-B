# 👋 Hi, I'm Alaeddin Bahrouni

**Computer Science Student at FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences** | **Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist**

I'm a Computer Science student with hands-on experience across the entire data science lifecycle. I enjoy building and analyzing ML models using Python and its data stack, and I have practical experience mentoring over 25 students in programming concepts. I'm currently seeking a Werkstudent role where I can apply my skills to solve real-world challenges.

## 🏆 Featured Projects

1. 🧠 **Perceptron & Neural Network for MNIST** (Educational)  
   Implemented a feed-forward neural network from scratch to recognize handwritten digits. Result: Achieved 97% accuracy on the MNIST test set after applying data normalization, sigmoid activation, and backpropagation.

2. 📈 **Movie Rental Duration Predictor**  
   Engineered new features and benchmarked multiple regression models to predict rental durations. Result: Tuned Gradient Boosting model achieved an RMSE of ≈1.37 (≈4.6% improvement over baseline).

3. 🐧 **Antarctic Penguin Species Clustering**  
   Applied K-Means clustering (k=3) and PCA for dimensionality reduction on penguin morphometric data. Result: Interactive 3D visualizations showing clusters aligning with Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species.

4. ⚡ **German Energy Price Forecasting (MLOps)**  
   End-to-end ML workflow for forecasting energy prices in Germany using MLOps best practices. (https://github.com/Alaeddin-B/german-energy-price-forecasting-mlops)
