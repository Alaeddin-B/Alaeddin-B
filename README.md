# 👋 Hi, I'm Alaeddin Bahrouni

**Computer Science Student @ FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences**  
**Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist**

I’m a Computer Science student passionate about turning data into insight and building ML models that solve real-world problems. I’ve mentored 25+ students in programming, gained hands-on experience across the data science lifecycle, and I’m now seeking a Werkstudent role in **Data Science / Machine Learning** to grow further in MLOps and deployment.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

1. 🧠 **Perceptron & Neural Network for MNIST**  
   [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/Alaeddin-B/Neural-Network-Playground)  
   Built a feed-forward neural network **from scratch (no ML frameworks)** to classify handwritten digits.  
   **Result:** 97% accuracy on MNIST test set using sigmoid activation, backpropagation, and normalization.

2. 📈 **Movie Rental Duration Predictor**  
   [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/Alaeddin-B/Movie-Rental-Durations-Predictor)
   Engineered features and benchmarked regression models to predict rental durations.  
   **Result:** Tuned Gradient Boosting model achieved RMSE ≈ 1.37 (≈4.6% better than baseline).

3. 🐧 **Antarctic Penguin Species Clustering**  
   [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/Alaeddin-B/Clusterin-Antarctic-Penguin-Species)  
   Applied K-Means clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction on penguin morphometric data.  
   **Result:** Interactive 3D visualizations showed clear separation between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species.

4. ⚡ **German Energy Price Forecasting (MLOps – WIP)**  
   [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/Alaeddin-B/german-energy-price-forecasting-mlops)  
   Capstone project to kick off my **MLOps / MLE journey**.  
   Focused on building an end-to-end ML workflow for German energy price forecasting using MLOps best practices. *(Work in progress)*
